# ChartExtract
 
 Built for Pixel 3 API 26. May not work on other versions and platforms.

Done for CMPT 381 (Implementation of Graphical User Interfaces) at the University of Saskatchewan.
 
 Android application that allows for a user to upload a image of a chart (Using the triple dot menu in the top right) and then extract data points from it. 
 
 Once chart has been uploaded resize the red box to the area of the chart you want to work with. Then set the range of the values of each axis in the top right.
 
 From here you may click within the chart and spawn yellow points whose values will be displayed in the top right in relation to the given parameters.
 
 Click and drag on the yellow points to move them. Only the most recently selected point's value will be displayed.
