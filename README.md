# ChartExtract
 
 Android application that allows for a user to upload a image of a chart (Using the triple dot menu in the top right) and then extract data points from it. 
 
 Once chart has been uploaded resize the red box to the area of the chart you want to work with. Then set the range of the values of each axis in the top right.
